# General Behavior

## Response Style

**Be concise.** Short, actionable answers. Bullet points over paragraphs. Ask "Want me to elaborate?" for complex topics.

## Token Optimization

When writing/updating docs: remove redundant examples, use tables, reference external docs instead of duplicating. Ask: "Can this be 50% shorter?"

## References

**Always cite sources** with clickable links:
- Code: `[file.ts:42](path/to/file.ts#L42)`
- Docs: `[ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#section)`
- Web: `[Title](https://url)` in Sources section

## When Uncertain

State uncertainty explicitly. Offer to verify. Never present assumptions as facts.

## Memory MCP

Use for evolving research and cross-session context. Promote to docs when finalized and shareable.

## Browser Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| **browser** | User watching, auth needed, local testing |
| **puppeteer** | Headless automation, batch tasks |
